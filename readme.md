</h1>
<hr>


This is merely a handy script that installs all python packages specified in a text file "packages.txt". I've used it countless times. Press a button, grab the popcorn and let the console ASCII text flow!

You will more than likely need to run the script (or Visual Studio if you're using it to run it) with administrator privileges, otherwise you'll be denied permission to install packages.

Requirements:

- Python 3.x version installed (only tested with 3.5 and 3.6.6)
- Latest pip version for the specified python version installed

I've used Windows 8.1 x86_64, Visual Studio 2017 IDE with Python tools and Python 3.6.6 interpreter.
